            My name is Daniel Medina. I am a high school student at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. I started my journey as a web developer in January of 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic I had a lot of free time therefore I was able to really bump up my skills. I started experimenting with all kinds of technologies and projects. As of August 2021 I have made 6 big projects which are listed below. I have also done some small projects which can be found in my Github a profile.

          I spend my free time listening and composing music, taking photos, sailing, and coding. I also love collecting vinyl records. I currently have a small collection of them, but plan to expand it indefinitely. Check out my collection here.
